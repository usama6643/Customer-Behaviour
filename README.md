Performed initial data inspection (shape, data types, missing values)

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing and null values

Removed duplicates

Standardized column names and data formats

Corrected data inconsistencies

3️⃣ Data Transformation

Created derived columns for analysis

Normalized categorical values

Prepared data for database insertion

4️⃣ Load to PostgreSQL

Created database schema and tables

Loaded cleaned and transformed data into PostgreSQL
